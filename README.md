# FunctionalKotlin

This is a step in an effort to learn Functional programming.
To really learn something, I need to work with it, implement it in some way, so I created this small application.
It's a classic Presenter -> Service -> Repository.
It has (or will have, when it's done :) ) three Git branches:

 Branch | Implementation
 --- | --- 
imperative | **Very** imperative! :)
functional | Functional implementation without any frameworks.  
functional_with_arrow | Functional implementation with [Arrow](https://arrow-kt.io/).
